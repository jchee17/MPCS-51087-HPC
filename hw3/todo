The main datastructures: 

Parameters (L, G)
	G: stores the problem parameters
	L: stores the problem parameters per proc
			note: I hope that n_particles remains constant
	new function: void parse_parameters_loc(Parameters *parameters_loc); 
	
Particle (L)
	created MPI_Particle struct 

Bank (L, G?)
	init_bank(), init_source_bank(), and init_fission_bank() dont need to
	be modified bc I have already changed parse_parameters()

Geometry (L)
	init_geometry() doesn't need to be modified bc I have already 
	changed parse_parameters()

Material (L)
	init_material() doesn't need to be modified bc I have already 
	changed parse_parameters()

Nuclide (G)
	init_nuclide() doesn't need to be modified bc I have already 
	changed parse_parameters()

Tally (L)
	init_tally() doesn't need to be modified bc I have already 
	changed parse_parameters()

I need to write:
	MAKE master = nprocs;
	relative placement of all procs. For now the distribution of procs
	is row major ordering starting from the top left, going from
	each verticle slice of the matrix through z.
		for now let nprocs = i^3 where (n_bins % i == 0)
	[x]*_lvl_mype() takes mype and give their x,y,z pos along each axis 
		(by proc region)
	[x]mype_from_lvls() lookup mype given x,y,z along each axis 
		(by proc region)
	[x]interior() which determines whether interior region or not
		based on mype	
	[x]exterior_surface() to determine if a particle is moved to
		either an interior surface, or to which exterior surface
	[x]buffer struct and functions to store out of bound particles
	[x]modify cross_surface()
	[ ]check that loc->global->loc&mype process in cross_surface_loc()
		is good
	[x]modify transport()
	[ ]communication routine in parallel run_eigenvalue(). will call modified
		run_eignevalue() as subroutine
	[ ]scatter global src_bank on 0proc to all other procs
		from buffer struct
		[x]fixed--GETTING A SEG FAULT WHY
		MPI_Finalize() hangs->because of sometihng in source_scater()
	[ ]master needs to send out d_proc;
	[ ]gather local fission_banks into global src_bank
	[ ]how to tally particles?
	[ ]I need to verify that correct things are being sent

	[ ]segfaults when greater than 1 batch or generation
	
Note: NEED TO FIX NPROCS VS N_WORkeRS
n_bins must be divisible by n_workers_axis
cube, gx=gy=gz

confused why I need this
gx must be divisible by nprocs
gy must be divisible by nprocs
gz must be divisible by nprocs
BUT I guess it'd be better if I accounted for the case where 
		these parameter variables are not divisible by nprocs.
